Using Python for data cleansing, processing, visualisation and build predictive model using linear regression and random forest regression to predict application rating.

We ran 4 regressions for the random forest regressor model, as we consider the model with one-hot and integer encoded, as well as the inclusion/exclusion of the genre section. It is proved to some extent that using integer-encoded variables perform better than one-hot encoded variables and interestingly, the inclusion and exclusion of genre data doesnâ€™t have a significant impact on the predictiveness of the model.
